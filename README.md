## Opis
My first adventure with coding.  Site was preapred during first weeks of YouCode course. It contains my short description (education, work experience, hobby). It's not perfect yet, but I'm proud :)

What I was learning:
- HTML
- CSS stuling 
- BEM convention
- simple interaction in JS
- introduction to functions - change background stopped working :/ If you have ideas why, kindly let me know.
